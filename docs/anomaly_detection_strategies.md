# Anomaly Detection Strategies

## Overview

This section covers the various strategies employed for detecting anomalies in time-series data.

### 1. Supervised Learning

- **Random Forest**: A supervised model that is trained on labeled time-series data, distinguishing between normal and anomalous patterns.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- **Isolation Forest**: This algorithm isolates anomalies by constructing random decision trees. It is effective for high-dimensional data.
- **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies outliers as points that do not belong to any cluster.

### 3. Deep Learning

- **LSTM**: Recurrent neural networks like LSTM are capable of learning temporal dependencies and detecting anomalies in sequences.
- **Autoencoder**: An autoencoder reconstructs input data and flags high reconstruction errors as anomalies.

### 4. Ensemble Methods

Combining predictions from multiple models can improve detection performance. The ensemble models leverage both traditional and deep learning approaches to minimize false positives and false negatives.
